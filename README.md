# Washington STEM's Highschool to Postsecondary Collaborative (H2PC)
## Survey Analysis Templates
### Last updated 3/21/2025. Scripts originally created by Brian Chu (@ScholarFund) and adapted by Rachel Tavolacci (@WashingtonSTEM).
### Code of Conduct: 
These templates are designed to help educators, especially high school and district staff, improve equitable
postsecondary readiness by better understanding patterns between high school experiences and
postsecondary outcomes. The data that school and district teams gather, analyze, and reflect on can
help 
* Surface, Confirm, and Challenge Hunches
* Understand patterns across high school coursetaking, financial aid completion, and postsecondary enrollment, persistence, and completion
* Uncover Root Causes and Addressing Adult Bias
* Understand how staff and students learn
about, talk about, and experience postsecondary preparation and support at school.
* Co-Develop Solutions. Increase trust and understanding of students’ and families’ experiences
and expertise, working together to identify impactful school-level changes.
* Change School Culture

These resources should be used to analzye strengths and weaknesses of the school system, not individual students, families, or staff.
