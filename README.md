# Washington STEM's High School to Postsecondary Collaborative (H2PC)
Today, only 50% of high school graduates in Washington enroll in higher education; however upwards of 80% of well-paying jobs in the state require some sort of postsecondary credential. This means many students, most often students of color and low-income students, will not have access to family-sustaining jobs and secure careers. 

Since it's inception in 2019 as a collboration with Eisenhower High School (EHS) in Yakima, WA, the High School to Postsecondary Collaborative has grown into a successful partnership led by Washington STEM and nine regional and district leads across 40+ schools across Washington state, focused on improving postsecondary preparation and transitions. When high schools join the High School to Postsecondary Collaborative, they learn how to check assumptions against course-taking data, collect surveys, host listen sessions with families, and receive professional development so more staff are equipped to advise students on dual credit options.

## Survey Analysis Templates
### Last updated 3/21/2025. Scripts originally created by Brian Chu (@ScholarFund) and adapted by Rachel Tavolacci (@WashingtonSTEM).
### Code of Conduct: 
These templates are designed to help educators, especially high school and district staff, improve equitable
postsecondary readiness by better understanding patterns between high school experiences and
postsecondary outcomes. The data that school and district teams gather, analyze, and reflect on can
help 
* Surface, Confirm, and Challenge Hunches
* Understand patterns across high school coursetaking, financial aid completion, and postsecondary enrollment, persistence, and completion
* Uncover Root Causes and Addressing Adult Bias
* Understand how staff and students learn
about, talk about, and experience postsecondary preparation and support at school.
* Co-Develop Solutions. Increase trust and understanding of students’ and families’ experiences
and expertise, working together to identify impactful school-level changes.
* Change School Culture

These resources should be used to analzye strengths and weaknesses of the school system, not individual students, families, or staff.
